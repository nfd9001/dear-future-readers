# It's me, your pal nfd

I'm another person who thought it'd be a neat idea to join the Github time capsule.
At the time of writing,
I'm alone at my parents' house in Seattle, King, Washington, USA.
I plan to write a little more over the coming week.
I'm 21 years old,
and I'm expecting a few quiet weeks of working, walking, reading, writing, and (potentially) thing-making.

I like making things.
Now that I've finished college (at least for the moment!) and I've found work,
I feel like I can throw a bit more attention towards making things again.
Lately, I've been spending a lot of time studying and writing about cultural issues.
I've also been interested in functional programming, especially in Haskell,
and the mathematics fields that connect to developing in that sort of way
(especially abstract algebra and category theory).
I'm also interested in very low-level computing and design:
once upon a time, in school, I wrote a small real-time operating system for a little microcontroller with a 
Cortex-M0 inside, and I've known that I need to find another experience like that ever since.

I'm a humanist. I think everyone is everyone's responsibility,
and it really saddens me that people tend to lose sight of that.
Hopefully we'll fix some more of the whole people-dying-every-day problem by the time you
crack into this.

I've got a pretty nice job, and I should be able to work down my college debt at a decent pace.
I hope to find some work that connects more deeply to my other interests over the coming years.

I hope Project Gutenberg, archive.org, and some of the world's libraries also find you well.
Many small organizations are archiving a lot of interesting things.
I also hope you'll get to witness a tick on the Clock Of The Long Now
(though I regret to tell you that I don't know for sure where it will be placed).
